## üß† Software Architecture & Behavior Logic

![Behavior Logic Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/images/robot_logic_flow_cam.png)

- **Normal Patrol Mode:** Continuous movement with ultrasonic sensors guiding obstacle avoidance.
- **Motion Detection:** When PIR sensor detects motion:
  - Buzzer sounds an alert.
  - ESP32-CAM receives trigger signal, activating live video stream.
- **Obstacle Encounter:** If blocked, the robot intelligently reverses and turns, avoiding deadlock or collision.
- **Telemetry:** Real-time sensor values and state transitions output via serial for debugging and performance tuning.

## üî¥ ESP32-CAM Streaming Integration

- Designed around the **ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker** board.
- Streaming only initiates when PIR sensor input is HIGH, conserving resources.
- Connects to the same Wi-Fi network as the main ESP32 board.
- Stream URL is configurable and accessible remotely.
  
### Wiring Summary for PIR Trigger

| PIR Output | ESP32-CAM Input |
|------------|-----------------|
| OUT (GPIO2 on ESP32) | GPIO13          |
| VCC        | 5V              |
| GND        | GND             |
